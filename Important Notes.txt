Sure, here are my notes based on the information you provided:

------------DAY-01------------
Topic: Machine-Learning 

Software Requirements: 
- Python 3.10.5
- Git (https://git-scm.com/)
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
- Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Jupyter in VS Code 

Steps: 
1. Install Python 3.10.5
2. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/
3. Install Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab 
4. Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/ (after installation, its name is Anaconda Navigator)
5. Install Jupyter in VS Code
6. To run a Jupyter program: 
    - In VS Code, press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command Palette
    - Type "Jupyter: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook"
    - Press Shift + Enter to run the program
7. If you get an error message saying "pip is not recognized" when trying to run Jupyter, try the following solution suggested by Piyush sir: 
    - Search on Google for "download get-pip.py"
    - Download the file from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py 
    - Open the Command Prompt and type "python get-pip.py" to install pip 


------------DAY-02------------
Topic: Identifiers and Keywords 

1. Keywords are reserved words in Python and cannot be used as identifiers. To see a list of all keywords in Python, type the following command in the Python console: 
    import keyword
    print(keyword.kwlist)

2. You can use the help() function to get information about keywords in Python: 
    help('keywords')

3. Operators in Python: 
    - Arithmatic: +, -, *, / , **


---------------- DAY-07--------------------
1. To exit the Python terminal, type Ctrl + Z and press Enter.

2. In Jupyter, you can use the ! sign to run terminal commands.

3. To use a module or package in Python, you can import it using the "from" and "import" keywords. For example: 
    import newpack
    newpack.pqr()

    from newpack import new1
    new1.xyz()

4. PyPI (Python Package Index) is an official website where you can find information about all Python packages. 

5. You can use the __init__.py file to directly import a module. 


---------------- DAY-09 --------------------
1. To install OpenCV, run the following command: 
    pip install opencv-python 

2. To install scikit-image, run the following command: 
    pip install scikit-image

3. To install Matplotlib, run the following command: 
    pip install matplotlib


---------------- DAY-10 (Image Processing and Computer Vision) --------------------
1. Image Processing: 
    - Image Enhancement 
    - Information Extraction 

2. Computer Vision: 
    - Image processing is a necessary step for computer vision 

3. Digital Image: 
    - Combination of pixels 
    - Pixel: intensity of light in an angle 
    - Resolution: number of pixels in horizontal and vertical direction 
    - PPI or DPI: pixel size 

4. Types of Images: 
    - True Color Image: uses RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model 
    - Other color models: CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value), BGR 
    - Digitally: 
        - Y = R + G 
        - M = R + B 
        - C = G + B
